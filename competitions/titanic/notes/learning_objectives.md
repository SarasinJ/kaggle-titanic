# Learning Objectives Derived from Assessment

Populate once initial gap matrix is scored. Adjust as skills improve.

## Core Concepts to Master

1. **Data Profiling & Cleaning**
   - Accurately diagnose missingness patterns and implement justified imputations.
   - Communicate findings via concise visual summaries.
2. **Feature Engineering for Tabular Data**
   - Derive meaningful categorical/grouping features (titles, family-size metrics).
   - Employ pipelines to keep transformations reproducible.
3. **Baseline Modeling Strategy**
   - Configure logistic regression and tree-based models with appropriate regularization.
   - Compare models using consistent splits and seeds.
4. **Model Evaluation Literacy**
   - Interpret accuracy, precision/recall, confusion matrices, and learning curves.
   - Explain overfitting indicators and mitigation tactics.
5. **Experiment Management & Git Hygiene**
   - Version datasets/notebooks responsibly; log experiments.
   - Write succinct experiment notes summarizing hypothesis, setup, and outcome.

## Implementation Milestones

- **Milestone 1**: Clean dataset + exploratory notebook with actionable insights.
- **Milestone 2**: Reproducible preprocessing + baseline model pipeline scoring >0.75.
- **Milestone 3**: Feature iteration with documented experiments and validation discipline.
- **Milestone 4**: Final submission codepath packaged for reruns (scripts + README).

## Reflection Prompts

- What did the latest assessment segment reveal about intuition vs. execution?
- Which concepts need repeated exposure vs. one-time clarification?
- How will you measure improvement (scores, time-to-complete, confidence delta)?
